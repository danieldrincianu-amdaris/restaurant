nfr_validation:
  security: 
    status: PASS
    notes: "WebSocket authentication handled by existing socket infrastructure. No new security concerns introduced."
  performance: 
    status: PASS
    notes: "useRef pattern prevents unnecessary re-renders. Event listener cleanup prevents memory leaks. Singleton socket pattern ensures single connection."
  reliability: 
    status: PASS
    notes: "Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff configured. Proper error handling in place. Event listeners cleaned up on unmount."
  maintainability: 
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear separation of concerns. Well-documented hooks with JSDoc. Type-safe payloads from shared package. Reusable ConnectionStatus component."

  production_readiness:
    - action: "Add ConnectionStatus component to app header for user visibility"
      refs: ["packages/web/src/components/ui/ConnectionStatus.tsx"]
    - action: "Consider adding toast notification on prolonged disconnection"

  monitoring:
    - action: "Log connection state changes to analytics in production"
      refs: ["packages/web/src/hooks/useSocket.ts"]
    - action: "Track event processing times for performance monitoring"
      refs: ["packages/web/src/hooks/useOrderEvents.ts"]

strengths:
  - "Excellent use of useRef pattern to stabilize callbacks and prevent unnecessary effect re-runs"
  - "Comprehensive test coverage at 100% with all 31 tests passing"
  - "Type-safe integration with @restaurant/shared package"
  - "Proper cleanup patterns prevent memory leaks"
  - "Clear separation between connection state (useSocket) and event handling (useOrderEvents)"
  - "Accessible ConnectionStatus component with proper ARIA attributes"
  - "Well-documented with JSDoc and usage examples"
  - "Fixed pre-existing bug in OrderBuilder during implementation"
