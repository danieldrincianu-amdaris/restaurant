  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client + server-side validation; no sensitive data in drag payload; existing auth middleware protects endpoints"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimistic updates <100ms perceived latency; efficient collision detection; minimal re-renders"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling present with revert logic, but no user-visible error notification (console.error only)"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture; JSDoc documentation; TypeScript type safety; well-maintained @dnd-kit library"
  accessibility:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Missing aria-labels; no screen reader announcements; keyboard support from @dnd-kit not tested; color-only visual feedback"
