# Review notes
notes: |
  This story demonstrates exemplary implementation quality. The developer showed
  strong attention to:
  
  1. Test Coverage: Multi-layered approach with hook, component, and integration tests
  2. Error Handling: Proper error preservation ensures users don't lose work
  3. Code Quality: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  4. User Experience: Loading states, confirmations, and clear validation feedback
  5. TypeScript: Proper typing throughout with no type shortcuts
  
  The implementation is production-ready with no required changes. This sets a high
  bar for future stories.
