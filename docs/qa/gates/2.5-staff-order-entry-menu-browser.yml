  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Client-side search with no XSS risks. API calls use typed interfaces.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Search input lacks debouncing (mentioned in AC7 requirements). Image lazy loading not implemented for large menus.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error handling, loading states, and empty states properly implemented. OrderContext prevents state loss.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear component separation, follows existing patterns. Minor: useEffect in useAvailableMenuItems could use useCallback for fetchItems.'
