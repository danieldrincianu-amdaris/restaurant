nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity. Cascade delete prevents orphaned records. No sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Strategic indexes on orders(status), orders(tableNumber), and order_items(orderId). Millisecond precision timestamps without excessive storage."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Foreign key constraints prevent data inconsistency. Default values ensure valid initial state. Non-nullable fields prevent incomplete records."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear field names, Prisma schema as single source of truth, version-controlled migrations, type-safe shared package."

detailed_findings:
  strengths:
    - "Schema design perfectly matches architecture.md specification"
    - "Performance indexes strategically placed for anticipated query patterns"
    - "Cascade delete properly configured to prevent orphaned OrderItems"
    - "TypeScript types fully aligned with Prisma models"
    - "STATUS_TRANSITIONS map provides clear business rules"
    - "Seed data provides good coverage across order statuses"
    - "Bidirectional relations correctly implemented"
    - "Clean separation: schema in API, types in shared package"
  
  architecture_quality: "Clean separation of concerns with schema in API package, types in shared package. Bidirectional relation between MenuItem and OrderItem correctly implemented."
  
  testability:
    controllability: "Excellent - Schema can be migrated/seeded deterministically"
    observability: "Excellent - Database queries, seed output, Prisma Studio, TypeScript types"
    debuggability: "Excellent - Migration history, seed progression, descriptive error messages"
